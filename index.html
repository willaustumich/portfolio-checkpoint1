		<p>Welcome to my cooking website. Whether you’re new to cooking, an expert, or somewhere in between, this site will give you the inspiration needed to become your best chef. By no means would I consider myself a five-star chef, just your garden variety home chef with a passion for making tasty and healthy meals. Ready to get started? Take a look around. I’m sure you’ll find some inspiration that makes you want to run to the kitchen.</p>

		<p>One great thing about cooking is how every culture and region has a different take on it. Vegetables, herbs, and spices that were available became distinct features in a culture’s dishes, even to this day. I like to try a little bit of everything and am always searching for more information on how to take what I’ve learned and incorporate it into other dishes. It allows me to treat my kitchen like a teleportation machine into another culture or period in time. What’s even better? It creates an endless cycle of new experiences and combinations that is surely to make working in the kitchen a joyous occasion.</p>
